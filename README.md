# Echecs_Irrlicht
Chess game in C++ with Irrlicht in CodeBlock (No AI or network support).

* Simply do :
   * `make all`, 
   * then `./chess`. 
   * (then `make clean` to remove the binary.) 
* Only working on linux.
* Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with packages :
   * libirrlicht-dev (1.8.3+dfsg1-1) 
   * libirrlicht-doc (1.8.3+dfsg1-1) 
   * libirrlicht-1.8 (1.8.3+dfsg1-1) 
   * Depending on the irrlicht installation and linux distro you have, you might have to change the library and include paths in the makefile.
