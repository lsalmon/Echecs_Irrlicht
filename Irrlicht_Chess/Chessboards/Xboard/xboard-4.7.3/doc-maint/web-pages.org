The home page for XBoard are kept in CVS. This is a unfortunate, since
we keep the code in git and hopefully will change in the
future. Luckily there is a cvsexport/import command for git that can help.

Possible setup:

cvs web page in /home/user/xboard-cvs
git in          /home/user/xboard-git

Add the following entries in /home/user/xboard-git/.git/config:

[cvsimport]
        module = xboard
        d = :ext:<savannah user name>@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/webcvs/xboard
[cvsexportcommit]
        cvsdir = /home/user/xboard-cvs

It's probably best to have a tracking branch for the cvs tree, one
that branch you should be able to use:

git cvsimport -a

to import all cvs-commits into the git tree. You can merge that branch
with the www-branch in git.

To push a git-commit (from branch www) into cvs, you can use:

git cvsexportcommit -v -c <sha1>

This can only be done one commit at a time AFAIK. In case of conflicts
cvsexportcommit will leave a .msg and patchfile (something like
.cvscommitpatch) in the CVS directory that you can apply by hand and
then fix the merge conflicts and apply the commit by hand via "cvs
commit" (use "cvs add <file>" if you need to add new files).

GNU also provides a script to update the online manual from the texi
file. It's called gendocs.sh (see same directory as this file). There
might be newer version around, so it could be worth checking for them
every now and then.
